# Product Overview

BJSUI is a modern Angular 20 application that creates a comprehensive HTML/CSS-like system in 3D space using BabylonJS. The project aims to render DOM elements and styling capabilities in a 3D environment, avoiding the standard BabylonJS GUI package due to its limitations.

## Core Concept
- Render HTML-like elements (div, img, a, ul, li, etc.) as 3D meshes in BabylonJS
- Apply CSS-like styling (borders, gradients, transforms, flexbox) to 3D elements
- Support interactive features (hover states, click events, navigation)
- Maintain web standards compatibility while leveraging 3D capabilities

## Key Features
- **Zoneless Architecture**: Uses Angular's experimental zoneless change detection
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enabled for better SEO and performance
- **Signals-First Approach**: Leverages Angular signals for reactive state management
- **3D DOM System**: Custom DOM elements rendered as BabylonJS meshes
- **CSS-like Styling**: Support for borders, gradients, transforms, flexbox layouts
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states, click events, and navigation

## Target Use Cases
- 3D web interfaces and dashboards
- Immersive data visualization
- Spatial user interfaces
- Creative web experiences that blend 2D and 3D concepts
